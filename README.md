####<Role>
####As a user I should be able to select the personality type of my choice which links to a show page with a form. I should be able to fill out this form with my name and question. The data that I typed would then be submitted as a post on the page were other users would then be able to comment and delete their comments related to mypost.


###<Goal>
####The goal of this app is have people communicate with one another and discuss personality difference and life experience with one another.
###<Reason>
####There has been a struggle to relate to one another. By making a platform for people to communicate their views, people can discuss their point of views.

###Link to your wireframes – sketches of major views / interfaces in your application
####(link to wire frame: https://wireframe.cc/rq4Iyl)
###Descriptions of any unsolved problems or major hurdles you had to overcome
####Some major hurdles I've encounter were adding comment and delete to each post. I've decided to try a different approach and make each post into a link.
####Each link will have there own show page which users will be able to add comments, and delete comments.
